The Project Kit Database ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit2_007s09_kitdatabase)) contains a list of 2.007 parts whose SolidWorks and/or Pro/Engineer models are available for download from the SolidWorks Part Archive ([ZIP - 7.6MB]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/partsarchive)). (The ZIP file contains: 106 .sldprt files, 9 .sldasm files, 2 .ord files, 74 .jpeg files, 3 .dxf files, 1 .cgm file, 2 .prt.5 file, 2 .prt.2 file, 2 .asm.2 files, 48 .prt.1 files, 7 .asm.1 files, and 1 .drw.1 file.)

Pro/Engineer Configuration ([ZIP]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/proeconfig)) (The ZIP file contains: 4 .frm.1 files, and 1 .pro file.)

Materials
---------

With the following exceptions, each machine must be constructed solely from materials provided in the kit.

*   You may use all the gears and bearings that you need, so long as **every single use** has been justified by good design practice and appropriate calculations to verify they will not be overloaded.
*   You may use additional fasteners and adhesives, but **only** for fastening and joining (no ballast, caltrops, table sticking devices etc.).
*   You may use washers as simple bearings and/or parts of a fastening system.
*   You may use bolts under 1 inch long as posts of pivot joints, but not as structural elements.
*   You may use lubricants, but only to reduce friction **within** your own machine (no oil slicks please).
*   You may use any materials for non-functional decorations (make your machine look really cool).

Students get to keep their machines intact. We only ask that students recycle unused components after the contest, especially motors!

The following items are not to be used inside the actual machine:

*   Green FREM boxes and purple lids
*   Catalogs and flyers

Note: Some items may vary slightly from what is listed on the web page.

**Important**: More information on using the control system is shown on the [control systems]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/projects/control_system_information) page. It is very important that you read this page before designing your robot, as it will require some planning. If you are making a robot with a microcontroller, make sure your electronics will work with the table control system.

Note on manufacturing parts: Please note that you must have a drawing before using the large machines (milling machines, lathes, water jet, etc). The shop guys will help you process the parts, but they will not make the parts for you. Drawings are not necessary, but are highly suggested, before processing materials using machines in the general area (belt sanders, drill presses, etc).
